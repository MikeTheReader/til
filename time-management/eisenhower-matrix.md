# Eisenhower Matrix

A matrix of how to prioritize tasks based on _urgency_ and _importance_.

From Steven Covey:

> __Urgent__ matters are those that require immediate attention. These are visible issues that pop up and demand your attention NOW. Often, urgent matters come with clear consequences for not completing these tasks. Urgent tasks are unavoidable, but spending too much time putting out fires can product a great deal of stress and could result in burnout.

> __Important__ matters, on the other hand, are those that contribute to long-term goals and life values. These items require planning and thoughtful action. When you focus on important matters you manage your time, energy, and attention rather than mindlessly expending those resources. What is important is subjective and depends on your own values and personal goals.
