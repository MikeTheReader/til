# Canonical URLs

A Canonical URL is a url contained in a `head` element of a webpage with `rel="canonical"`. The canonical URL tells Google and other search engine crawlers what URL to index the specific page content under.

Multiple URLs can point to the same page, and this allows Google to point folks to the URL you want them to use. (`www.example.com` vs `example.com` for example.)

Also important is that they help search engines consolidate information for a given URL. Syndicated content (content reproduced on another site) will be ranked under the same URL and so won't end up competiting for traffic.
